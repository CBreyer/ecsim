ECSim-GUI is a general use GUI for more practical use of PyECsim.
The GUI was written using tkinter as the foundation of the GUI. 

It features:

•	Saving, loading, and exporting functions of graphical data.

•	Adding and removing redox and reaction events.

•	Plotting multiple graphs on top of each other (MultiPlot feature).

•	The greatest advantage this GUI has over other GUI offered is the MultiPlot feature.

By selecting the number of overlayed plots, the variable you wish to modify, and the bounds at which you want the variable to be plotted between. Multiple plots of the graph will all be overlayed on top of each other showing what effect modifying that variable will have. This is an extremely useful tool for troubleshooting simulations as well as generating plots to be used for educational purposes. 

Additionally, in the ‘Py2exe Compiled’ folder, there is a windows 64bit standalone version of the current version of this GUI. To use this version, either download the entire folder and run the ECSim-GUI-1.1.exe file or download the file labeled ‘ECSim-GUI-1.2-Setup.exe’ which is a standalone installer of ECSim-GUI created using Inno Setup Compiler
